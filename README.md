# Project Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to our collaborative Master's degree Machine Learning project, led by Eva in collaboration with me and Aziz. This project focuses on brain tumor MRI classification using Python.

## Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model for automated brain tumor MRI classification.
- Utilize Python as the primary programming language and make use of ML libraries (Tensorflow , scikitLearn, etc .. ).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/darshitsharma2000/brain-tumor-classification).

## How to Use

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
